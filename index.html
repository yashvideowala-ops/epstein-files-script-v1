            Jeffrey Edward Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1953. By the 1980s, he had transformed himself into a mysterious financial advisor, claiming to manage money only for billionaires.

            But how did he make his fortune? That question has never been fully answered. What we do know is that by the 1990s, Epstein owned a mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a sprawling estate in Palm Beach, Florida, a ranch in New Mexico, and a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
